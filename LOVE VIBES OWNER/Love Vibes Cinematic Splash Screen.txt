Love Vibes: Cinematic Splash Screen Blueprint
Version: 1.0.0
Duration: 7 seconds
Style: Hollywood Teaser / Prestige Film Opening

1. Design Philosophy
"A moment of anticipation before connection."
This splash screen is not a loading screen—it's an experience. Inspired by premium film studio intros (A24, Focus Features, Searchlight), it establishes emotional tone before the user enters the app. Rich, cinematic, memorable.
Core Principles:

Luxury Over Speed: Users should want to watch it
Sensory Immersion: Visual, audio, haptic harmony
Emotional Priming: Sets the mood for meaningful connections
Brand Memorability: Unforgettable first impression


2. Visual Composition
2.1 Canvas Setup
Aspect Ratio: Full screen (9:16 for mobile)
Background: Deep gradient fade
Resolution: 1080×1920px minimum
Frame Rate: 60fps (120fps for ProMotion displays)

3. Logo Animation Sequence
Phase 1: The Emergence (0.0s - 1.2s)
Heart Outline Formation:
Start: Center of screen, invisible
0.0s - 0.3s: 
  - Heart outline draws itself (path animation)
  - Stroke: 3px, #F8E5D8 (cream gold)
  - Speed: Consistent, elegant (ease-in-out-cubic)
  - Draw direction: Top center → left curve → bottom point → right curve → top center
  
0.3s - 0.5s:
  - Pause (breath moment)
  - Subtle glow pulse appears around outline
  - Glow: 8px blur, #D4AF37 (gold), 40% opacity
  
0.5s - 1.2s:
  - Heart fills with gradient (top to bottom wipe)
  - Gradient: 
      Top: #E8867C (soft coral)
      Middle: #C75B5C (rose)
      Bottom: #8B3A3A (burgundy)
  - Fill animation: Smooth liquid pour effect
  - Shine pass: Subtle light sweep across surface (left to right)
The "Heartbeat" Moment (0.7s):
Single pulse animation:
  - Scale: 1.0 → 1.08 → 1.0
  - Duration: 0.4s
  - Easing: Cubic bezier (0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1) - slight overshoot

  - Audio: Deep "thump" (60Hz bass note, 0.3s decay)
Phase 2: The Reveal (1.2s - 2.4s)
"LOVE VIBES" Typography Entry:
Position: Center, below heart (32px spacing)
Font: Custom thin sans-serif (matching logo)
Size: 48px
Tracking: 0.15em (wide letter spacing)
Color: #F8E5D8 (cream gold)

Animation:
1.2s - 1.8s:
  - Letters fade in sequentially (left to right)
  - Each letter: 0.08s fade + 0.06s scale (0.95 → 1.0)
  - Stagger delay: 0.05s between letters
  - Result: Gentle cascade effect
  
1.8s - 2.0s:

Phase 3: The Elevation (2.4s - 3.5s)
Cinematic Finale:
2.4s - 3.0s:
  - Entire logo group (heart + text) slowly scales up (1.03 → 1.15)
  - Simultaneous subtle rotation (0° → 2° → 0°)
  - Background glow intensifies (spreads 40% wider)
  - Particles accelerate upward movement
  
3.0s - 3.3s:
  - Logo reaches peak luminosity
  - Additional shine pass (diagonal, faster than Phase 1)
  - Edge glow: 20px blur, #D4AF37 (gold), 60% opacity
  
3.3s - 3.5s:
  - Fade out preparation:
    - Logo opacity: 100% → 85%
    - Background crossfade to app feed gradient
    - Particles dissolve outward

4. Audio Design
4.1 Sound Layers
Base Layer - Ambient Pad:
Instrument: Warm synth strings
Frequency: 80-400Hz (low-mid warmth)
Duration: Full 3.5s
Volume curve: Fade in (0-0.5s) → sustain → fade out (3.0-3.5s)
Emotion: Intimate, safe, inviting
Accent 1 - Heart Draw (0.0s - 0.3s):
Sound: Soft "whoosh" with delicate chime tail
Texture: Crystalline, pure
Volume: 40% of mix
Purpose: Sonifies the heart outline drawing
Accent 2 - Heartbeat (0.7s):
Sound: Deep bass thump (60Hz) + soft high sparkle (8kHz)
Duration: 0.3s
Volume: 60% of mix
Purpose: The emotional anchor moment
Accent 3 - Text Cascade (1.2s - 1.8s):
Sound: Gentle marimba notes ascending scale
Notes: 5-note progression (C-D-E-G-A)
Volume: 30% of mix

Purpose: Smooth handoff to app interface
4.2 Audio Specifications
Format: AAC 256kbps (mobile optimized)
Sample Rate: 48kHz
Bit Depth: 24-bit (rendered), 16-bit (delivered)
Loudness: -18 LUFS (comfortable, not jarring)
Dynamic Range: 12dB (controlled but expressive)

5. Haptic Choreography (iOS/Android)
iOS (CoreHaptics)
swiftTimeline:
0.0s: Light impact (draw start)
0.7s: Medium impact (heartbeat) - PRIMARY MOMENT
1.2s: Selection feedback (text start)
2.4s: Light impact (finale begin)
3.0s: Subtle notification (completion)

Intensity Curve:
Low → MEDIUM → Low → Low → Very Low
Android (Vibration API)
Pattern: [0, 20, 80, 180, 0, 10, 10, 10, 10, 0, 30]
Amplitudes: [0, 40, 0, 180, 0, 30, 35, 40, 45, 0, 50]

Translation:
- Initial tap (20ms)
- Pause, then HEARTBEAT (180ms @ 180/255 strength)
- Micro-pulses for text (4× 10ms)
- Finale bump (30ms)

6. Technical Implementation
6.1 Animation Technology
Primary: Lottie JSON (Recommended)
File size: < 150KB (optimized)
Advantages:
  - Vector-based (resolution independent)
  - Smooth 60fps playback
  - Small file size
  - Native platform support
Export from: After Effects with Bodymovin plugin
Alternative: Native Code (For max control)
iOS: Core Animation + UIKit Dynamics
Android: Property Animation + Canvas API
Advantages:
  - Tighter integration with haptics
  - Dynamic color adaptation (dark mode)
  - Lower memory footprint
6.2 Asset Checklist
Required Files:
├── splash_animation.json (Lottie file)
├── splash_audio.m4a (Audio track)
├── particles_texture.png (Particle sprite, 32x32px)
└── logo_fallback.svg (Static backup if animation fails)

Optional (for native):
├── heart_mask.png (Alpha channel for glow effects)
└── gradient_map.png (LUT for color grading)
6.3 Performance Optimization
Target Metrics:
- Cold start: Display within 400ms of app launch
- Animation playback: Locked 60fps (no dropped frames)
- Memory usage: < 20MB peak
- Battery impact: < 1% drain per view

Techniques:
- Preload animation in app bundle (no network fetch)
- Use GPU acceleration (Metal/OpenGL compositing)
- Mute audio if device is silent (respect user preference)
- Skip animation on subsequent launches (24hr cooldown)
- Provide "Skip" gesture (tap anywhere after 1.5s)

7. Contextual Behavior
7.1 When to Show
Always Show:

First launch (onboarding flow)
App updated to new version
User hasn't opened app in 7+ days

Abbreviated Version (1.5s):

Cold starts after < 24 hours
Returning from background quickly
Low battery mode active

Never Show:

Opened via deep link (direct to content)
During authentication flow
In accessibility "reduce motion" mode (show static logo)

7.2 Accessibility Adaptations
VoiceOver/TalkBack:
Announce: "Love Vibes. Finding meaningful connections."
Timing: After 0.5s delay (let audio establish)
Skip button: Appears immediately, top-right
Reduce Motion:
Replace animation with:
- Static logo (full opacity)
- Gentle cross-dissolve in (0.5s)
- Hold for 1.0s
- Cross-dissolve out (0.5s)
Total: 2.0s
Hearing Impaired:
Audio is supplementary, not essential
Visual timing stands alone (tested muted)

8. Transition to Main App
8.1 Exit Animation (3.3s - 3.5s)
Logo:
  - Opacity: 100% → 0%
  - Scale: 1.15 → 1.3 (zooms slightly forward)
  - Blur: 0px → 8px (soft defocus)
  
Background:
  - Cross-fade to Feed screen gradient (0.2s overlap)
  - No jarring cut—seamless blend
  
First Feed Card:
  - Enters from bottom (slide-up 40px)
  - Opacity: 0% → 100%
  - Timing: Begins at 3.4s (0.1s overlap with splash)
8.2 State Handoff
On animation complete:
1. Save timestamp (prevent immediate replay)
2. Initialize main app state (Redux/Context)
3. Prefetch first 3 profile cards
4. Establish WebSocket connection (background)
5. Request location permission (if not granted)

9. A/B Testing Variants
Variant A: "Classic" (Described Above)

Full 3.5s duration
Orchestral audio
Heartbeat emphasis

Variant B: "Minimal"

2.0s duration
No particles
Single heartbeat pulse
Faster typography reveal

Variant C: "Ethereal"

4.0s duration
More particles (80-100)
Slower drift
Ambient vocals instead of orchestra

Test Metrics:

Completion rate (% who watch full sequence)
Skip rate (% who tap to skip)
Session start delay acceptance
User feedback (post-onboarding survey)


10. Brand Consistency Checks
✅ Color Accuracy:

Logo gradient matches brand guide exactly
Background gradients use approved palette
Particle gold matches verified badge color

✅ Typography:

"LOVE VIBES" uses exact logo typeface
Letter spacing identical (0.15em)
Weight matches (thin/300)

✅ Emotional Tone:

Sophisticated, not playful
Intimate, not loud
Aspirational, not desperate

✅ Cross-Platform:

iOS and Android see identical visuals
Audio normalized to same perceived loudness
Haptics adapted to platform strengths
