# Love Vibes: Monetization & Engagement Blueprint
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** 2026-01-19  
**Status:** Revenue Architecture & Content Strategy

---

## 1. Monetization Philosophy

**"Enhance, Never Gate."**

Love Vibes follows the **premium freemium model**: The core experience (browse, match, chat) remains free forever. Revenue comes from enhancing the journey—more visibility, deeper insights, and expressive tools.

**Pricing Psychology:**
- **Value perception:** "Investment in yourself" not "paying to date"
- **Fair pricing:** Transparent, no hidden costs
- **Reward loyalty:** Better value for committed users
- **Ethical design:** No manipulation, no artificial scarcity

---

## 2. Currency System: Love Credits

### 2.1 The Foundation

**Love Credits** are the universal in-app currency. Soft, emotional branding over "coins" or "gems."

```
Symbol: ✨ (sparkle emoji in UI)
Display: "120 Credits" or "✨120"
Color: #D4AF37 (gold, matching verified badge)
Icon: Sparkle with subtle animation (gentle pulse)
```

### 2.2 Credit Packages

**Smart Pricing Tiers:**

| Package | Credits | Price (USD) | $/Credit | Bonus | Best For |
|---------|---------|-------------|----------|-------|----------|
| **Starter** | 50 | $4.99 | $0.10 | — | Try features |
| **Popular** | 120 | $9.99 | $0.08 | +20% | Most chosen |
| **Premium** | 300 | $19.99 | $0.07 | +50% | Power users |
| **Ultimate** | 1000 | $49.99 | $0.05 | +100% | Serious daters |

**Purchase Flow:**
1. Tap credit balance (top-right corner, always visible)
2. Bottom sheet slides up with packages
3. Highlight "Popular" with subtle glow
4. One-tap purchase via App Store/Google Play
5. Instant credit deposit + confetti animation

**Microcopy:**
- Button text: "Get Credits"

## 9. Content Strategy: Microcopy & UX Writing

### 9.1 Core App Messaging

**Onboarding:**
```
Welcome screen: "Find Your Vibe"
Phone input: "Your number stays private"
Mode selection: "What brings you here today?"
Photo upload: "Show your authentic self"
Video intro: "15 seconds to shine—be you!"
Location: "Discover vibes around you"
```

**Feed Interactions:**
```
Empty feed: "You're all caught up! Adjust your preferences to see more."
First match: "Congrats on your first match! Say hi 👋"
Super Like sent: "They'll know you're really interested!"
Boost active: "You're on fire! 🔥 Your profile is boosted for 27 more minutes"
Out of credits: "You're out of credits—but the vibes don't have to stop!"
```

**Chat:**
```
Match notification: "You matched with Alex! Start the conversation"
First message prompt: "Say something interesting—they're waiting!"
No response: "Give them time—good things take patience"
Unmatch warning: "Are you sure? This can't be undone."
Report user: "We take safety seriously. Thanks for reporting."
```

**Profile:**
```
Incomplete profile: "Your profile is 60% complete. Add a video intro to stand out!"
Trust score tooltip: "Your trust score is based on verification, activity, and community feedback"
Mode switch: "Switched to Friendship mode—your feed will update shortly"
Verification pending: "We're reviewing your photos. You'll be verified within 24 hours."
```

### 9.2 Monetization Messaging (Ethical Selling)

**Soft Sell (Non-Intrusive):**
```
Credit balance low: "Running low? Top up to keep the magic going ✨"
After 5 matches: "You're on a roll! Boost your profile to match with even more people"
Viewing blurred likes: "Curious who likes you? Reveal them instantly"
```

**Feature Discovery (Educate):**
```
Tooltip on locked feature: "This is a Plus feature. Tap to learn more"
After using free Rewind: "Out of Rewinds. Plus members get unlimited!"
Read receipts: "Wonder if they saw your message? Turn on Read Receipts"
```

**Value Framing (Benefits, Not Features):**
```
❌ Avoid: "Upgrade to get 5 Super Likes per day"
✅ Instead: "Stand out and get 3x more matches with Super Likes"

❌ Avoid: "Subscribe for $14.99/month"
✅ Instead: "Invest $14.99/month in finding someone special"

❌ Avoid: "Buy 120 credits for $9.99"
✅ Instead: "Unlock 120 moments of connection for $9.99"
```

### 9.3 Retention & Re-engagement

Streak reminder: "Don't lose your 5-day streak! Open Love Vibes today"
Boost expiring: "Your profile boost ends in 5 minutes—make it count!"
```

**Email Campaigns:**
```
Day 1: "Welcome to Love Vibes—Here's how to get started"
Day 3: "Tips from our community: How to write a great bio"
Day 7: "You've been here a week! Here's what you've unlocked"
Day 30: "Looking back on your first month—plus 25 free credits!"
Inactive 14 days: "We miss you! Come back for a surprise"
```

**In-App Tooltips:**
