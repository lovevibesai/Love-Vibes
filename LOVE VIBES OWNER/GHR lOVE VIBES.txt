## Development Principles

* **Main branch is always deployable**
* No direct commits to `main`
* All changes via pull requests
* Clear, intentional commit history
* Secrets never committed to Git

---

## Branching Strategy

```
main            → production-ready
feature/*       → new features
fix/*           → bug fixes
hotfix/*        → production emergencies
```

---

## Local Development (High-Level)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Each app (`backend`, `frontend`, `mobile`) can also be run independently.

---

## Deployment

Deployment is handled via Cloudflare:

* Backend: Cloudflare Workers
* Frontend: Cloudflare Pages
* Database: D1
* Media: R2

See `docs/deployment.md` for the authoritative production checklist.

---

## Security

This repository is **private** and intended for authorized internal contributors only.

* Secrets are managed via Cloudflare and environment variables
* Stripe webhooks are signature-verified
* Abuse protection via rate limits, WAF, and moderation pipelines

See `docs/security.md` for details.
