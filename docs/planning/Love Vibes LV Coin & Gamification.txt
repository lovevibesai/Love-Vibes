**Version:** 2.0.0 (Blockchain Integration)  
**Date:** 2026-01-19  
**Status:** Crypto-Native Architecture

## PART 1: LV COIN CRYPTOCURRENCY SYSTEM

### 1.1 Token Economics (Tokenomics)

**LV Coin Specifications:**
```
Token Name: Love Vibes Coin
Ticker Symbol: LVC
Token Standard: ERC-20 (Ethereum) / BEP-20 (Binance Smart Chain)
Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 LVC (1 Billion - Fixed)
Decimals: 18
Contract Type: Upgradeable Proxy (for future features)
```

**Supply Distribution:**
```
40% - User Rewards Pool (400M LVC)
   ├─ Daily activities, streaks, achievements
   ├─ Referrals, content creation
   └─ Community events, challenges
   
25% - Platform Treasury (250M LVC)
   ├─ Operational expenses
   ├─ Partnership incentives
   └─ Marketing campaigns
   
15% - Liquidity Pool (150M LVC)
   ├─ DEX listings (Uniswap, PancakeSwap)
   └─ Market-making reserves
   
10% - Team & Advisors (100M LVC)
   ├─ 4-year vesting, 1-year cliff
   └─ Locked in smart contract
   
5% - Wedding Party Fund (50M LVC)
   ├─ Couples who marry after meeting on platform
   └─ Community-voted distributions
   
5% - Seed Investors (50M LVC)
   ├─ 2-year vesting, 6-month cliff

Transaction Fees (on-chain):

```

### 1.6 Blockchain Verification System

**Identity Verification (On-Chain):**
```
Process:
1. User uploads government ID + selfie
2. AI performs liveness detection + document validation
3. Hash of verification proof → stored on-chain (IPFS + Polygon)
4. User receives "Verified" badge (NFT-based, non-transferable)
5. Verification status = immutable, publicly auditable

Privacy Protection:
├─ No personal data on-chain (only hashes)
├─ Zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) confirm "verified" without revealing details
└─ User controls who sees verification badge

Benefits:
✅ Fake profiles eliminated (can't fake blockchain records)
✅ Trust score boost (+20 points for verified users)
✅ Eligible for premium features
```

**Profile Integrity:**
```
Every profile action recorded on-chain:
├─ Account creation timestamp (immutable)
├─ Verification status (updated via oracle)
├─ Reputation events (warnings, bans) → transparent history
└─ Wedding announcements (permanent record)

Use Case: Sarah wants to verify Jake isn't a scammer
→ Views his blockchain record: "Verified Jan 2025, 0 violations, 47 positive ratings"
→ Confidence to proceed with date
```

### 1.7 NFT Integration

**Profile NFTs (Soulbound Tokens):**
```
Each verified user receives a unique Profile NFT:
├─ Visual: Animated avatar (user's photo + Love Vibes frame)
├─ Metadata: Verification date, trust score tier, milestones
├─ Non-transferable (bound to account)
├─ Evolves over time (changes with achievements)

Rarity Tiers:
🥉 Bronze: 0-50 trust score (gray border)
🥈 Silver: 51-75 trust score (white glow)
🥇 Gold: 76-90 trust score (gold shimmer)
💎 Diamond: 91-100 trust score (rainbow aura)
```

**Collectible Gift NFTs:**
```

### 2.3 Trust Score (Reputation System)

Calculation Formula:
Trust Score = (Verification × 0.3) + (Activity × 0.2) + (Community × 0.3) + (Behavior × 0.2)

Components:
1. Verification (30%):
   ├─ Blockchain-verified ID: +30 points
   ├─ Photo verification: +10 points

2. Activity (20%):
   ├─ Account age (longer = better): 0-10 points
   ├─ Profile completeness: 0-5 points
   ├─ Response rate: 0-5 points
   
3. Community (30%):
   ├─ Average rating from dates: 0-20 points
   ├─ Positive reports: -10 points per violation
   ├─ Referrals/success stories: +5 points each
   
4. Behavior (20%):
   ├─ No harassment reports: +10 points
   ├─ Active conversations (not ghosting): +5 points
   ├─ Real-world meetups confirmed: +5 points
```

**Trust Score Benefits:**
```
High Trust (76-100):
✅ Priority in feed algorithm

## PART 3: TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### 3.1 Smart Contract Architecture

**Primary Contracts (Solidity):**

```solidity
// LVCToken.sol - ERC-20 Token
contract LVCToken {
  string public name = "Love Vibes Coin";
  string public symbol = "LVC";
  uint8 public decimals = 18;
  uint256 public totalSupply = 1000000000 * 10**18;
  
  mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;
  mapping(address => uint256) public stakedBalance;
  
  function transfer(to, amount) public returns (bool);
  function stake(amount, duration) public returns (bool);
  function claimRewards() public returns (uint256);
}

// VerificationNFT.sol - Soulbound Token
contract VerificationNFT {
  mapping(address => bool) public isVerified;
  mapping(address => uint256) public verificationDate;
  
  function mint(user, proofHash) onlyOracle public;
  function revoke(user) onlyAdmin public;
  function getVerificationStatus(user) public view returns (bool);
}

// WeddingFund.sol - DAO Governance
contract WeddingFund {
  struct Proposal {
    address coupleA;
    address coupleB;
    uint256 requestedAmount;
    string storyIPFS;
    uint256 votesFor;
    uint256 votesAgainst;
  }
  
  function submitProposal(coupleA, coupleB, story) public;
  function vote(proposalId, support) public;
  function executeProposal(proposalId) public;
}

// GiftNFT.sol - Limited Edition NFTs
contract GiftNFT {
  uint256 public maxSupply = 10000;
  uint256 public currentSupply = 0;
  
  function mintGift(recipient, metadata) public payable;
  function setRoyalty(percentage) onlyOwner public;
}
```

**Oracle Integration (Chainlink):**
```
Use Case: Sync off-chain data (user activity) to on-chain (trust score)

Chainlink Functions:
├─ Fetch trust score from D1 database
├─ Update VerificationNFT contract
├─ Trigger rewards distribution
└─ Price feed (LVC/USD for in-app display)

Frequency: Every 6 hours (batch updates to save gas)
```

## PART 4: MONETIZATION SYNERGY

### 4.1 LVC ↔ Credits Conversion

**Dual Currency Strategy:**
```
Why Both?

Credits (Fiat-Based):
✅ Easy for non-crypto users
✅ Stable pricing (no volatility)
✅ App Store compliant
✅ Target: Casual users, older demographics

LVC (Crypto-Based):
✅ Appeals to Web3 natives
✅ Can earn through activity (no purchase required)
✅ Tradeable, stakeable, collectible
✅ Target: Tech-savvy, younger users, investors

Conversion Rate:
1 LVC = 2.5 Credits (dynamic, updates hourly based on LVC/USD price)

Users can:
├─ Buy Credits with fiat ($9.99 → 120 credits)
├─ Buy LVC with crypto (0.1 ETH → ~1,000 LVC)
├─ Convert LVC → Credits in-app (100 LVC → 250 credits)
├─ Use either for purchases (UI shows both prices)

Example: Profile Boost
├─ Option 1: Pay 20 Credits (from fiat purchase)
├─ Option 2: Pay 8 LVC (from earned rewards)
├─ User chooses preferred currency
```

### 4.2 Revenue Streams (Updated)

**Primary Revenue:**
```
1. Subscriptions: $14.99-$29.99/month (Plus/Platinum)
2. Credit purchases: $4.99-$49.99 packages
3. LVC sales: $9.99-$149.99 packages (+ platform fee 5%)
4. Transaction fees: 4% on LVC transfers, 2% on staking
5. NFT marketplace: 10% royalty on secondary sales
6. Venue partnerships: 10% commission on bookings
7. Physical merchandise: 30-50% margin
8. Wedding fund sponsorships: Brand partnerships
```

**Projected Annual Revenue (Year 1, Realistic):**
```
500,000 MAU

Subscriptions:
├─ 7% convert (35,000 paid)
├─ Avg $18/mo (mix of Plus/Platinum)
├─ Annual: $7,560,000

In-App Purchases (Credits + LVC):
├─ 15% purchase (75,000 users)
├─ Avg $25/year per buyer
├─ Annual: $1,875,000

Transaction Fees:
├─ $500,000 (LVC transfers, staking)_id) REFERENCES Users(id)
